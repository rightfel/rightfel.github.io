                Hi, I am Hanifan Rizki Nurahman.

                Lead Data and AI services at IBM-JTI and a Statistics graduate from the
                Padjadjaran University. My main focus these days is explore the
                possibility of generative AI and Rust web development with Axum
                and Leptos.

                In my free time you will find me grinding my programming skills at
                Leetcode, or write some blogs article to add some internet
                footprint in this vast and crowded world.
